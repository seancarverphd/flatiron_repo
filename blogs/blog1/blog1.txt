Why I chose data science.

Even before I heard the term "data science," a career involving
"science" and "data" struck me as a natural choice.  Since 2003, when
I earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University, I
have been employed in data intensive scientific fields.  Soon after
graduation from Cornell, I started working as a researcher at the
University of Maryland, studying human balance control.  I later moved
back and forth between Johns Hopkins University and Yale University
researching motor control and neuroscience.  Finally, in 2013, I
started teaching mathematics and statistics at American University.

Despite giving me an introduction to data, my early training prepared
me to study models, not data.  A model is a mathematical description
of what to expect from data.  Models codify assumptions about physical
systems.  Cornell trained me to study and understand the implications
of such modeling assumptions and I turned this training into a
successful academic career.

Although, my Ph.D. dissertation contained visualizations and analyses
of data from a human locomotion lab, the analyses remained pretty
simple from the perspective of data science.  Soon after I left
Cornell, I identified a desire to advance my career by getting my
hands dirty with real-world data and sophisticated analyses---while
still staying true to my training in modeling.  So I started studying
statistical methods for fitting models to data.  These methods allow a
principled construction of models using data from the physical system,
rather than from guesses and first principles.

To try to understand the statistical methods better, my first
model-fitting projects involved simulated data---in other words, data
from known and well understood models of physical systems, not the
physical systems themselves.  One might say that I could not escape
from my training: I still studied models, keeping my hands clean from
real-world data.  Nevertheless, my results confirmed the value of this
approach.

I and others at the University of Maryland wanted to develop a
diagnostic tool for understanding what part(s) of the postural control
system failed for each subject when they experienced repeated falls.
We expected that such a tool would help treat fall-prone individuals,
common for different reasons among the elderly.  A patient with
sensory deficits should be treated differently than a patient with
motor deficits, and both should be treated differently from a patient
with different central deficits.  We planned a simple perturbation
approach, with a model-fitting analysis of data from each patient's
postural sway, to understand precisely what part of the system failed
and why.

To our surprise, my modeling approach saved the lab a lot of time and
money by showing that under very general conditions, a so-called
pole-zero cancellation would thwart our diagnostic ambitions, even in
the easiest to examine patient: a mathematical model patient.  I
analyzed and understood the mathematical conditions that doomed our
proposed diagnostic tool, and showed that techniques more invasive
than ethically possible would be needed to rectify the situation.  I
published this negative result in 2009, still with hands clean of
real-world data from fall-prone subjects.  Fortunately, I had already
moved to an animal lab, where such experiments were possible, but
keeping to my wheelhouse, all four of my papers that came from that
lab remained similarly theoretical, involving different ways of
understanding models of animal motor control.

Sometime later, in 2013, I began teaching mathematics and statistics
at American University.  While at AU, my department started a data
science degree program and I participated in its formation.  In the
process, I learned a lot about the field.  Indeed, I first became
aware of the term "data science" at AU.  With my colleagues, I had
discussions about what employers would want from AU's graduates.  I
explored Kaggle, and started reading job postings. The whole
experience left me intrigued and drawn to this exciting profession.  I
became more and more aware of the revolution in data storage and
amazed by the enormous volume of data available to the public at
little to no cost.  I purchased a library of data science books at a
price substantially higher than the public data, and started taking on
projects to develop my skills.

I sought out a colleague Misha Ahrens doing big data research in
neuroscience.  With data he gave me, I performed an intrinsic
dimension calculation for a calcium imaging of the neural activity
in the whole brain of the larval zebrafish performing a sensorimotor
task.  At AU, I taught an R-based Introduction to Statistical
Computation and Modeling class.  As a result, I took on new research
interests---the topics that showed particular popularity among my
students' class projects---specifically baseball and twitter.  I
published one baseball paper on my own and I am preparing another
baseball manuscript (with co-author undergraduate Jake Berberian).
Additionally, I have planned a collaboration with a colleague (AU
Professorial Lecturer Jacob Ward) analyzing tweets from twitter.

But another long-term project is closest to my heart---something of
greater significance that will matter to the world.  I set an
intention to discover and communicate insights from publicly
available data that will foster hope, courage, love, compassion,
forgiveness, and positive engagement in human society.  This ambition
has given me new meaning and purpose to my life, but for lasting
success I need more training.

In January 2019, when I heard about a free fellowship for a data
science boot camp at the Flatiron School in DC, I realized that the
time had come to make my move to a more traditional data science
career.  After the fellowship, I want to support myself and my family
with a data science job that will allow me to fully engage creatively
in challenging problems, and provide a safe, fulfilling, supportive
environment for success, stimulate my personal growth, and give me the
opportunity to learn and progress in my career.  I still want to
discover and communicate insights that will foster hope, courage,
love, compassion, forgiveness, and positive engagement in human
society, but I am not specifically looking for this opportunity in a
job.  Instead, I will continue to do these and other projects,
independently, on my free time.  But I will look to my job to help me
develop the skills needed to engage with these pursuits on my own.
Indeed, my personal ambitions may guide my career.  For example,
because I believe that many of the insights most helpful to human
civilization will come from textual data, I seek training and work
opportunities that will develop my skills in natural language
processing, data wrangling, and machine learning relevant to deriving
insights from data.  I don't know what I will write about data science
a year from now but I am very excited about the journey that
continues.
